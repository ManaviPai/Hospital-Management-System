# Hospital-Management-System

## Abstract

```
  The scope of Database management system is not hidden from any organization. They
play an influential role in organizing data for various organizations. One such
organization is the hospital which stores the patient records. This database makes
storage of records simple and efficient as it can accommodate a wide range of details of
the patient making it easy to extract and analyze the data.
  In this project, we aim to create a patient record system for a family as a whole. The
patient database can be accessed by the doctors the appointment has been set with. The
availability of them too, can be extracted from the database. Some diseases and
deficiencies are passed on in the family over generations and the database helps keep a
record of that. It also warns the patient to avoid medications that the patient is
hypersensitive to. The doctor can refer to the previously entered data of the patient from
the database and use it for the upcoming treatments and appointments.
